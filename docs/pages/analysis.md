## Correlation
Here some stuff of correlation between the different weather parameters and energy consumption.

#### "Static" correlations
Static correlation showning roughly how different weather parameters affect to the energy consumption. When the correlation is negative (temperature for example) it means that when temperature goes down the electricity consumption goes up.

#### Rolling correlations

Rolling correlations for of different weather attributes and energy consumption for the industrial customer (ic).

## Regression models
* What weather elements affect the electricity consumption?
* Can we predict energy consumption reliably and how far ahead?

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

* * *

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
